# yada-lang やだ言語

Yada lang is a language interpreter create for compilers study on top of Ruby.
The language uses a LISP style syntax.

## TODO

- [] Replace the parser generator with [lrama](https://github.com/ruby/lrama)
- [] Move to a new syntax style, LISP style is easy to start create an parser based on block syntax but would be nice to have something original.
